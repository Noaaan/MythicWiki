## Mythic Metals Wiki

This repository contains the basis of what the Mythic Metals Wiki is going to be. The [theme used is the same as Wisp Forest](https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs-theme), and is also included as a submodule in case you want to serve the site locally.

### Cloning

If you only want to make small modifications that do no require actually building the site, clone like normal:

`git clone https://github.com/Noaaan/MythicWiki.git`

If you want to make larger contributions, you will have to clone recursively via SSH. This is due to the current setup of the theme requires SSH authentication, and to serve the site locally you need the theme as well.

`git clone git@github.com:Noaaan/MythicWiki.git --recursive`
