Things like infobox (admonition) templates, header structure, formatting, style guides, etc. Motivation \u00b6 For the longest time I have wanted to write an actual wiki for Mythic Metals. A little bit of context: I play a lot of RPGs and MMORPGs 1 . When I play these, I expect a good wiki to provide clear, structurized and detailed information about whatever topic I am looking for. There are multiple examples on great wikis out there. Some of the wikis I currently enjoy reading are the Hypixel Skyblock Wiki , the Old School RuneScape Wiki , and of course, the Minecraft Wiki . All of them thrive on the community, and the extent of the documentation just goes to show how deep the love for the games go. Most of used to be hosted on Fandom a site built on the popular MediaWiki framework. I really like this structure, but for Fandom specifically I do not like the advertisements placed all across the page, they are really intrusive. I have also heard rumors regarding fairly restrictive theming options compared to what people can do when self-hosting. These reasons add up, so going DIY is definitely the best solution. I already have some experience working on the Wisp Forest docs, and with the open-source nature of the Mythic Metals project, and my studies related to programming in all forms, I am therefore able to serve a wiki like this. An interesting development has taken place as of writing, where more and more people are moving to more independent wiki pages. Hypixel moved to the Official Hypixel Wiki, and the Minecraft Wiki moved away from Fandom fairly recently. The links were therefore updated accordingly. Currently the best way to gain information is through the GitHub wiki, the Discord Server , or the few guides on YouTube that have surfaced after a long period of time 2 . In terms of the Discord Server: since you get to ask me directly, or perhaps you find one of the many handy pins in the #mythic-metals channel, you relatively quickly learn about what you want to know. I am not going to close down the Discord server after completing this wiki, but linking to it makes it faster to answer the same questions again and again. Some of the repetitive questions that I often receive are on how old and new features work, what ore height-ranges are, material statistics, and crafting recipes. All of these are easily solvable with a few blurbs of text and an image or two. Admonitions \u00b6 Stormyx Can be made into tools and armor Tool Durability = 1305 Helmet = (3), 360 durability Chestplate = (8), 480 durability Leggings = (6), 450 durability Boots = (3), 390 durability Ability - Magic Protection: Flat magic damage reduction by X points per piece. There is some text here If you look at any of the wikis in the motivation section, and look at any sort of weapon, you will often find an aside , serving an infobox with a quick summary of its core stats. I want to do something similar with most of the Mythic Metals materials, though for now I simply do not know how exactly I want to do it. This page will contain examples of what those would look like. Once I have decided on a good format, this will instead reflect the required format of all infoboxes on the Wiki.

Palladium Armor is a set of orange armor set which has multiple fire related properties. This armor is fireproof, similar to Netherite, and will therefore not burn if dropped in lava . Most of the pieces have the Movement Speed in Lava attribute, which does exactly what its named after. The helmet comes with the Vision in Lava attribute instead, which increases your vision range when submerged in Lava by the specified number of blocks. The set also comes with the Natural Fire Protection ability, which acts as one extra level of the Fire Protection enchantment when worn. This ability stacks with the enchantment itself. Obtaining \u00b6 Crafting \u00b6 Palladium Armor can be crafted from Palladium Ingots , which is a resource found in The Nether. It is crafted just like any other armor. Trivia \u00b6 Palladium Armor counts as warm armor, as it is in the minecraft:freeze_immune_wearables tag. This mean you will not take freeze damage when wearing any piece of it. Palladium Boots also have some interesting applications, as when wearing them you can stand on Campfires and Magma Blocks without taking damage. You will also not sink in Powder Snow when wearing these boots, unless you are sneaking.","title":"Palladium Armor"},{"location":"armor/palladium/#palladium-armor","text":"","title":"Palladium Armor"},{"location":"armor/palladium/#obtaining","text":"","title":"Obtaining"},{"location":"armor/palladium/#crafting","text":"Palladium Armor can be crafted from Palladium Ingots , which is a resource found in The Nether.
