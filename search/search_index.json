They contain tons of detailed information about what materials are interesting, as well as recipes for alloys. Note that two of the advancement have Alloy Forgery Forge Controllers in them. These are direct hints in what Tier you need to forge the specific alloys. How do I make alloys? \u00b6 Create an Alloy Forge. In a general unmodified Mythic Metals context a Tier 2 Forge can create any alloy. How do I craft X? \u00b6 All recipes follow vanilla patterns. For example when crafting a pickaxe follow the pickaxe pattern (i.e. 3 stone and two sticks), or use the associating smithing template . The rest, including Alloy Recipes , can be viewed using recipe viewers like Roughly Enough Items or EMI . As of writing Just Enough Items (JEI) is not supported. Where can I find X? \u00b6 Most of the ores spawn in the Overworld, some spawn in The Nether. End Stone Starrite spawns in The End. There are some biome-exclusive ores, listed here: Aquarium: Spawns in Aquatic Biomes, like Rivers and Oceans Prometheum: Spawns in Warm Biomes, like Lush Caves, or Jungles Osmium: Spawns in Mountains For where ores spawn specifically, this will eventually make its way into the wiki in the Material section. For now you can enjoy this chart made by Mkat420 (yes, it is still mostly accurate) Related biome tags (technical stuff) \u00b6 Overworld: spawns anywhere in the #mythicmetals:mythic_ore_biomes tag, which includes #c:in_overworld Aquarium: spawns anywhere in the #mythicmetals:aquarium_biomes tag, which includes #c:is_aquatic In older versions (below 0.20.2) this used to be only #c:aquatic Prometheum: spawns anywhere in the #mythicmetals:prometheum_biomes tag, which includes #minecraft:is_jungle Osmium: spawns anywhere in the #mythicmetals:osmium_biomes tag, which includes #c:mountain and #c:extreme_hills The Nether and The End are currently not tag-driven, and simply uses Fabric API to insert into all relevant biomes. In the future this might be changed. Can I mine this? \u00b6 Mythic Metals follows the vanilla progression closely. As a rule of thumb: Once you get a Netherite Pickaxe you can mine any ore in the mod. There are however multiple pickaxes in the mod that also have this mining level . As of writing the following pickaxes have this mining level: Hallowed Adamantite Mythril Orichalcum Palladium Star Platinum Once the wiki is complete, it will contain information on which mining levels tools have , and what mining levels ores require . What does X material do? \u00b6 This one will eventually be answered once the Material section is filled out. For now you can see the following subquestions: How does Branding work? \u00b6 You apply the Heat status effect to your targets by hitting them with a Palladium tool, and once they are hot enough light them on fire to make them combust! This heavily increases the fire damage and duration of their burn. Use this to your advantage in places where water is scarce (or simply drain the nearby water). The way this works is that the effect applies Fire Vulnerability. An extra effect of this is that Fire Resistance will not make you fully immune against burning, only reducing the damage. How do the Prometheum abilities work? \u00b6 Regrowth \u00b6 Prometheum equipment with this ability will automatically repair itself while in your inventory or equipped. In older versions of the mod (below 0.20.0), the effect was the following: For armor, it must be equipped for this to take effect For tools, it must be in your main hand or off hand to repair itself Overgrown \u00b6 Regrowth will track how much durability has been restored. Once you hit a threshold of durability regained, the armor will gain additional stats. The Regrowth self-repair effect will also increase when Overgrown. In the latest versions (0.20.0 and above), the thresholds are the following: At 1200 durability repaired, tools gain +1 damage. Armor gains +1 armor and armor toughness. At 2400 durability repaired, the bonuses above increase to the following: +2 damage for tools +2 armor & toughness for armor In the older versions, the thresholds looks like this: From 0.19.5 to 0.19.9, the double threshold was added to tools only. In 0.19.4 and below this double threshold did not exist. In 0.18.2 and below, the threshold was 2000 durability. Engrained \u00b6 If you apply Curse of Binding on the Armor, it will gain additional stats (+1 toughness and +8% attack speed per piece), as well as an increase on the Regrowth effect. Where can I find Smithing Templates? \u00b6 Here are the directions of how to obtain the Smithing Tables (up-to-date as of 0.18.2): Unobtainium Alloy Upgrade Found in Ancient Cities Allows you to craft Metallurgium and Celestium Gear from Netherite and Diamond respectively Can be duplicated with Diamonds and Deepslate Royal Midas Gold Sword Upgrade Rarely found when bartering with Piglins using Midas Gold Allows you to upgrade a maxed Gilded Midas Gold Sword into its final form... Can be duplicated with Diamonds and Deepslate Mythril Drill Upgrade Found in Mineshafts Upgrades a Mythril Pickaxe, using a Durasteel engine, into a Mythril Drill Can be duplicated with Diamonds and Deepslate Midas Gold Folding Crafted in the crafting table using Midas Gold and Netherrack Used to increase the gold counter on any Midas Gold Swords by 1 Can be duplicated for nuggets once you have made one Carmot Staff Found in Village Temple chests. In vanilla this only spawns in Desert Village Temples Not to be confused with Desert Temples, which resemble pyramids. The structure you are looking for is more like a small sandstone castle Can be duplicated with Diamonds and Smooth Basalt Carmot Upgrade Crafted from Carmot, Diamonds, and Smooth Basalt Upgrades Kyber Gear into its Carmot equivalent Can be duplicated using Carmot, Smooth Basalt, and Carmot Nuggets Legendary Banglum Upgrade Crafted from Banglum Ingots and Tuff Upgrades Banglum Gear to its Legendary variant using a Banglum Chunk Aegis Sword Upgrade Obtained from trading with Villagers, specifically Master level Clerics Can upgrade a Palladium Sword to the Blade of the Aegis Can upgrade a Hallowed Sword to the Sword of the Aegis How do I upgrade a Mythril Drill? \u00b6 Any item with the tooltip \"Mythril Drill Upgrade\" should be insertable in the Mythril Drill. Simply right click the upgrade item onto the drill to insert it. A video example is below. This is the same mechanics as the Bundle uses. For the available list of Drill Upgrades, see the following table: Method Description Relevant versions Enchanted Midas Gold Block Golden Luck - Gives you +2 Luck while holding the drill, and randomly drops raw gold when breaking an ore. 0.18.0+ Prometheum Bouquet Slowly repairs the durability of the drill. 0.18.0+ Aquarium Pearl Aqua Affinity - Increases your mining speed underwater, and restores a small amount of air when breaking an ore. 0.17.0+ Stormyx Shell Banglum Defuser - Drastically reduces the chance of Banglum exploding. 0.17.0+ Carmot Stone +1 Fortune - Increases the level of Fortune on your drill by one level. 0.18.0+ How much Midas Gold can you fold onto a Midas Gold Sword? \u00b6 I don't remember the exact amount. It stops getting new stats after 20 stacks of blocks, I think... What blocks can I put into the Carmot Staff? \u00b6 Literally anything inside the vanilla Minecraft and Mythic Metals. You cannot put a used Shulker Box though, as you would void your items doing so. Any Blocks in the #mythicmetals:carmot_staff_blocks are considered unique, and have an associated effect. See the following table: Block Description Relevant Versions Iron Fling opponents up, makes the staff stronger. 0.14.0+ Gold Grant yourself luck for two minutes. 0.14.0+ Copper Summon lightning on yourself. 0.14.0+ Diamond Makes the staff stronger. 0.14.0+ Bronze Smite whoever you strike with lightning. 0.14.0+ Netherite Powerful melee weapon, makes the staff much stronger. 0.14.0+ Metallurgium Highest single hit damage in the entire mod, but extremely slow. 0.14.0+ Carmot Heals you and everything around you for 10 points (5 hearts) of health. 0.14.2+ Midas Gold Grants you and everyone around you Luck 2 for four minutes. 0.14.2+ Runite Barrages your enemies in ice, freezing them in place. 0.14.2 to 0.16.4 Star Platinum Lets you swing the staff really fast. 0.14.2+ Beacon Grants players in a large radius (18 blocks) a random beacon effect for 30 seconds. 0.14.2+ Lapis Grants more experience to the user while being held. 0.14.2+ Stormyx Creates a forcefield while holding that reflects projectiles. 0.16.0+ Sponge Removes water in a 12 block radius. 0.17.0+ Hallowed Makes the staff much stronger. 0.17.0+ Forge? \u00b6 No. The reason is simple - I do not have the time to do so. I would much rather actually finish Mythic Metals and get it out of beta before considering porting it to an entirely different loader Froge??? \u00b6","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions-and-answers","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions and Answers"},{"location":"faq/#is-there-a-guide-for-this-mod","text":"Read the advancements.

Things like infobox (admonition) templates, header structure, formatting, style guides, etc. Motivation \u00b6 For the longest time I have wanted to write an actual wiki for Mythic Metals. A little bit of context: I play a lot of RPGs and MMORPGs 1 . When I play these, I expect a good wiki to provide clear, structurized and detailed information about whatever topic I am looking for. There are multiple examples on great wikis out there. Some of the wikis I currently enjoy reading are the Hypixel Skyblock Wiki , the Old School RuneScape Wiki , and of course, the Minecraft Wiki All of them (with a tiny exception for the officially supported RuneScape Wiki) are driven entirely by the community, and the extent of the documentation just goes to show how deep the love for the games go. Most of them use Fandom (MediaWiki) as their base. I really like this structure, but for Fandom specifically I do not like the advertisements placed all across the page, they are really intrusive. That is why I decided I wanted to self-host the wiki in some way. I already have some experience working on the Wisp Forest docs, and with the open-source nature of the Mythic Metals project, and my studies related to programming in all forms, I am therefore able to serve a wiki like this. An interesting development has taken place as of writing, where more and more people are moving to more independent wiki pages. Hypixel moved to the Official Hypixel Wiki, and the Minecraft Wiki moved away from Fandom fairly recently. The links were therefore updated accordingly. Currently the best way to gain information is through the GitHub wiki, the Discord Server , or the few guides on YouTube that have surfaced after a long period of time 2 . In terms of the Discord Server: since you get to ask me directly, or perhaps you find one of the many handy pins in the #mythic-metals channel, you relatively quickly learn about what you want to know. I am not going to close down the Discord server after completing this wiki, but linking to it makes it faster to answer the same questions again and again. Some of the repetitive questions that I often receive are on how old and new features work, what ore height-ranges are, material statistics, and crafting recipes. All of these are easily solvable with a few blurbs of text and an image or two.

Palladium Armor is a set of orange armor set which has multiple fire related properties. This armor is fireproof, similar to Netherite, and will therefore not burn if dropped in lava . Most of the pieces have the Movement Speed in Lava attribute, which does exactly what its named after. The helmet comes with the Vision in Lava attribute instead, which increases your vision range when submerged in Lava by the specified number of blocks.
