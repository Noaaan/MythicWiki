# Specification
This page will (eventually) contain the common elements used for this wiki. Things like admonition templates, what headers should be use, formatting style, etc.

## Motivation
For the longest time I have wanted to write an actual wiki for Mythic Metals.

A little bit of context: I play a lot of RPGs and MMORPG's[^1]. When I play these, I expect a good wiki to provide clear, structurized and detailed information about whatever topic I am looking for. 

There are multiple examples on great wikis out there. Most of the wikis I really enjoy reading are the [Hypixel Skyblock Wiki](xel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Hypixel_SkyBlock_Wiki), the [Oldschool RuneScape Wiki](https://os.rs.wiki), and of course, the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki). All of them (with a tiny exception for the officially supported RuneScape Wiki) are driven entirely by the community, and the extent of the documentation just goes to show how deep the love for the games go. 

Most of them use Fandom (MediaWiki) as their base. I really like this structure, but I do not like the advertisements placed all across the page, they are really intrusive. That is why I decided I wanted to self-host the wiki in some way, and since I already have some experience working on the Wisp Forest docs, and with the open-source nature of the Mythic Metals project, and my development experience, I am therefore able to serve a wiki like this. 

Currently the best way to gain information is through the GitHub wiki, or the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/69cKvQWScC). You get to ask me directly, or perhaps find one of the many handy pins in the `#mythic-metals` channel, about what you want to know. I am not going to close down the Discord server after completing this wiki, but linking to it makes it faster to answer the same questions again and again. Some of the repetitive questions that I often receive are on how old and new features work, what ore height-ranges are, material statistics, and crafting recipes. All of these are easily solvable with a few blurbs of text and an image or two.
