*War... War never changes*

So you want to learn how to build a nuke, huh? Well, its not so hard as you think. Does require a lot of specialized materials.

## Multiblock

You are going to need a lot of Banglum and Morkite. The multiblock is going to cost you 14 blocks of Banglum Blocks, and 12 blocks of Morkite, structured like this:

For the core of the bomb you need a Banglum Chunk as well.

To finally light it, simply use your trusty Flint and Steel...

... and get out as fast as you can.

## Unique Nuke Cores

Some might ask: "How do you use the different Nuke Cores?"

Well, it is simple: replace the Banglum Nuke Core with the new one when building it. Nothing more, nothing less.

### Carmot Nuke Core

Using this nuke core, the explosion will magically exclude all ores when it explodes

### Quadrillum Nuke Core

This nuke core will sacrifice some of the radius, while doubling the damage dealt from the explosion
