The Stormyx Shield is a magical round shield crafted from [Stormyx](../materials/stormyx.md).

Compared to a standard shield it has some minor benefits. Firstly it can take a higher amount of damage before losing durability. A standard shield can absorb 3 points of damage before losing durability, while a Stormyx Shield can absorb 4 points. It also rounds down during this durability damage calculation instead of up.

Secondly, when disabled by an axe, it goes on a second shorter cooldown of 4 seconds (80 ticks), allowing you to start using it quicker.

## Obtaining

### Crafting

The Stormyx Shield is crafted from [Stormyx Ingots](https://youtu.be/nEmXCTZN154), which is a resource found in <span style="color:orange">The Nether.</span> You also need a [Stormyx Shell](../materials/rare-drops.md), a rare dropped which is obtained while mining Stormyx Ores.
