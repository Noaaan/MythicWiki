    *Ability - Natural Fire Protection:* <br>
    Acts as extra levels of Fire Protection when worn.<br>

Palladium Armor is a set of orange armor set which has multiple fire related properties. This armor is fireproof, similar to Netherite, and will therefore **not burn if dropped in lava**.

Most of the pieces have the <span style="color:orange">Movement Speed in Lava</span> attribute, which does exactly what its named after. The helmet comes with the <span style="color:orange">Vision in Lava</span> attribute instead, which increases your vision range when submerged in Lava by the specified number of blocks. 

The set also comes with the <span style="color:orange">Natural Fire Protection</span> ability, which acts as one extra level of the Fire Protection enchantment when worn. This ability stacks with the enchantment itself. 

## Obtaining
### Crafting
Palladium Armor can be crafted from [Palladium Ingots](https://youtu.be/6wWHZE14hP8), which is a resource found in <span style="color:orange">The Nether.</span> It is crafted just like any other armor.

## Trivia
Palladium Armor counts as warm armor, as it is in the `minecraft:freeze_immune_wearables` tag. This mean you will not take freeze damage when wearing any piece of it.

Palladium Boots also have some interesting applications, as when wearing them you can stand on Campfires and Magma Blocks without taking damage. You will also not sink in Powder Snow when wearing these boots, unless you are sneaking.
