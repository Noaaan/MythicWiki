# Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

### Is there a guide for this mod?
Read the advancements. They contain tons of detailed information about what materials are interesting, as well as recipes for alloys.
Note that two of the advancement have Alloy Forgery Forge Controllers in them. These are direct hints in what Tier you need to forge the specific alloys. 

### How do I make alloys?
[Create an Alloy Forge.](https://modrinth.com/mod/alloy-forgery) In a general unmodified Mythic Metals context a Tier 2 Forge can create any alloy. 

### What does X material do?
This one will eventually be answered once the Material section is filled out. For now you can see the following subquestions:

#### How does Branding work?
You apply the Heat status effect to your targets by hitting them with a Palladium tool, and once they are hot enough light them on fire to make them combust!
This heavily increases the fire damage and duration of their burn. Use this to your advantage in places where water is scarce (or simply drain the nearby water).
The way this works is that the effect applies Fire Vulnerability. An extra effect of this is that Fire Resistance will not make you fully immune against burning, only reducing the damage.

#### What does the Prometheum abilities do?
*Regrowth*

- Prometheum will automatically repair itself
- For armor, it must be equipped for this to take effect
- For tools, it must be in your main hand or off hand to repair itself

*Overgrown*

- Regrowth will track how much durability has been restored
- Once you hit a threshold of around 2000 durability regained, the armor will gain additional stats
- The regrowth self-repair effect will also increase on tools

*Engrained*

- If you apply Curse of Binding on the Armor, it will gain additional stats, as well as increase the self-repair effect more.

### How do I upgrade a Mythril Drill?
Any item with the tooltip "Mythril Drill Upgrade" should be insertable in the Mythril Drill. Simply right click the upgrade item onto the drill to insert it. A video example is below. This is the same mechanics as the [Bundle](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bundle) uses.

For the available list of Drill Upgrades, see the following table:

| Method      | Description                          | Relevant versions   |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------: | :---:               |
| Enchanted Midas Gold Block | Golden Luck - Gives you +2 Luck while holding the drill, and randomly drops raw gold when breaking an ore.  | 0.18.0+ |
| Prometheum Bouquet | Slowly repairs the durability of the drill. | 0.18.0+ |

| Carmot Stone | +1 Fortune - Increases the level of Fortune on your drill by one level. | 0.18.0+ |

### How much Midas Gold can you fold onto a Midas Gold Sword?
I don't remember the exact amount. It stops getting new stats after 20 stacks of blocks, *I think...*

### What blocks can I put into the Carmot Staff?
Literally anything inside the vanilla Minecraft and Mythic Metals. You cannot put a used Shulker Box though, as you would void your items doing so.

Any Blocks in the `#mythicmetals:carmot_staff_blocks` are considered unique, and have an associated effect. See the following table:

| Block       | Description                                                                     | Relevant Versions|

### Forge?
No. The reason is simple - I do not have the time to do so. 
I would much rather actually finish Mythic Metals and get it out of beta before considering porting it to an entirely different loader

### Froge???
