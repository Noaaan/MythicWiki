# Welcome to the Work In Progress Mythic Metals Wiki

### :material-account: For Users
- If you're a user, you're probably looking for unobtainium. I have not written that page yet, and it will probably the last one.
- You can also find epic docs for some of the other pies I have dipped my fingers into, over at [https://docs.wispforest.io](https://docs.wispforest.io)
- The documentation for [Mythic Metals](spec.md) is also available here. Who would have guessed.

**The wiki is not dead!** I have been very slowly working on getting tooling done, and finally I should be able to more effectively put out pages for stuff. In the near future I want to make an FAQ and essentially re-host everything that is already available in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Noaaan/MythicMetals/wiki) and the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/69cKvQWScC). 

### :material-code-json: For Developers
- Just ask me in the [**Wraith Coding Sesh Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/69cKvQWScC) if you want to integrate your mod with mine. I will gladly help out/make hooks for my mod if you need them.
